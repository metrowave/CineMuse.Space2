The CineMuseSpace installation A Cinematic Home of the Everyday in partnership with the Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art (CFCCA) in Manchester is produced. In this installation, stencilled lines on the floor and real objects and furniture create an augmented reality ‘home’. The cinematic projections fill the gap between the abstract and the very real to combine a unique atmosphere. The installation forms part of an exhibition on Future Cities and runs from 1st August 2019 until 20th October 2019 with free admission.

The project creates its first exhibition entitled A Cinematic Museum of the Everyday in the Nextmixing Gallery in Shanghai.
